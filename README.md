# In this project, I designed a captcha creator in order to generate large number of image captchas for model training
# Before running the create_captcha.py, you should first install captcha in your computer by typing: pip install captcha
# Then you can run the create_captcha.py to generate captcha images in to images file.
# you can also change the variable "num" in the 41 lines of create_captcha.py to generate any number of images you want.
# Make sure not set the number too large!!! (keep it below 2000)
